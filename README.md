#  Web server project(node.js)

In this project, we created a web server without using any library just using node.js.

## First :Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/Lo-Agency-Internship/Ehsan-NodeJS-WebServer.git
```

## Second: Open the terminal where the project was downloaded.


```bash
  cd Ehsan-NodeJS-WebServer
```



Start the server by running:

```bash
  npm run start
```

Put the file in the public folder.

Enter the following URL in the browser bar

http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:3000/

If you do not put the file in the public folder, the airbnb site will run by default.
